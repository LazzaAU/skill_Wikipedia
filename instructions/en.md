<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Get Wikipedia results</strong></span>

Some examples of what to say : 

### NOTE: This method works best for single word searches like "search wiki for info on cheese"
- Hey Alice/Snips

- "i need some online info about finland"
- "get me information from wikipedia about Trump"
- "can you do a search about nuclear weapons on wiki please"
- "could you search some info online",
- "search wiki about apple",
- "search wiki for info about Switzerland"
- "search wiki for electricity"

### Note This below method works better for multi word searches, like "search wiki for info on "blue cheese"

or simply say 

- "search wikipedia"
 
when Alice asks
 
 - "sure what would you like me search for" ? 

Say your search item {EG: Blue cheese"}

**Known bad results**. 

Often due to the way certain wiki pages are written, you will come across the odd strange result. 
But over all the percentage of good results out weigh the bad results

results such as :

- === Heading === will make some if not all TTS engines say equals equals equals or any other random charactor
 based line

- Some pages are reported as no page id despite the fact they exist. such as a search for "Henry Ford" 
If you strike a un expected page. try asking a different way for the desired page.

- Some suggested alternatives also don't seem to be a good alternative. However alot do. 
So on the strange alternatives have a go at asking for them, and see where it takes you. 
Might take you from looking up why the sky is blue to what cows eat in egypt *shrug*. Who knows, 
just enjoy the journey :)
